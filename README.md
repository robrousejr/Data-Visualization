# Data Visualization

A collection of my data visualization projects

* **TV Series Ratings** - Creation of a chart in which it will display all of the IMDB ratings for each episode of whatever show you would like. It will also display the result in a graph which will point out both the highest and lowest rated episode throughout the entire series.
